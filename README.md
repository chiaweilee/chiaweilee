I told the AI, "In the distance, a colossal mushroom cloud billowed upwards into the vast expanse of sky, its form both ominous and mesmerizing. Close by, a solitary figure stood, gazing at this spectacle with a mixture of awe and contemplation. The scene was rendered in rich hues of red, as if through the lens of an ultra-wide-angle camera that captured not just the visual drama but also the underlying symmetry inherent in nature's unpredictable grandeur. This tableau seemed to unfold like a piece of quilling art, each fold and curl backlit to accentuate the contrast between light and shadow, evoking a sense of profound depth and narrative within the frame."

However, the AI tends to envision the world in an overly idealized manner.
